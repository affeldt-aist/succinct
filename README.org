* Compact data structures in Coq

*WARNING*: due to a suspected bug in Coq (reported as https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/9581), this code doesn't 
actually work. Everything works except for ~ddelete~, but attempting to define ~ddelete~ triggers an anomaly 
in Coq. Before we confirm this issue with Coq developers, we will need to hold on.
